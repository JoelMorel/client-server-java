1. Compile all files in both packages: client and server

2. Run the Server.java class first making sure to pass in one argument: the port you wish to use. (ex: 3000)
If successful, you will see waiting for incoming connections message in console.

3. Run the Client.java class afterward, making sure to pass in three arguments:
IP address, port number, # of shuttle threads you want created. (ex: localhost 3000 7)
If successful, you will see a "Client connected successfully" message in the console.

4. Program will execute

5. The client side will terminate on its own. The server side will finish executing its side of the code, and
continue to run waiting for other incoming requests from other clients. Terminate on your own after you are done.

NOTE: Program has been tested and proved to work with localhost only.
